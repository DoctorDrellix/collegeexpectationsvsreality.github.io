          <p>Prior to enrolling in college, it appears as though the essence of life revolves around an endless cycle of friendship, festive gatherings, and a seemingly non-stop procession of late-night parties. It seems like an environment where there are no restrictions on how long one can revel in the festivities and indulge in a life without a single worry or concern.

          <p>With the newly found freedom also comes the undeniable urge to explore every corner of the city from the famous monuments to visiting the best cafes with your friends. Every day seems like it would be a fun day, for who cares about classes, college means I would be a free bird. And even professors in college aren't as pestering as the teachers back in high school.</p>

          <p>College life is going to be more energetic and exciting than high school ever was. You'd cruise through the life at college with ease and be an all-rounder that you've always wanted to be.</p>

            The only parties that you'll go to, will be the after-hours hostel parties wherein you'd sneak in your friend's room and celebrate with hushed voices fearing the wrath of the warden if caught. And as far as the invitations are concerned the only invites that you'll get are from your textbooks and classroom notes to memorize them, that's unless you want to fail or be held back that semester.

          <p>It's true that professors in college are not as pestering as your teachers back in high school. But the sad truth is, unlike in the high school where your teachers ran after you in college you'd be the one running after them. Like it or not, most of the times it would be about attendance issues for if you don't meet the minimum attendance criteria then you had no chance of sitting for exams. So, sure, you will have your chance at exploring the city but it just won't be an everyday scenario.</p>
          <img src="studying.png" alt="" height="215px">
          <p>That's not quite true as most of your time would be spent in front of a laptop, trying to study. You will find yourself procrastinating more than you actually did in high school.</p>
